# Implementation Plan

## Overview
The `src/core/simulation.ts` file is growing large and needs to be refactored for better maintainability and scalability. This plan outlines the phases for this refactor.

## Goals
- Break down the large `simulation.ts` file into smaller, more manageable modules.
- Improve code readability and maintainability.
- Ensure the refactor does not introduce any regressions.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Initial Analysis
- Create the `.agent` directory and the `IMPLEMENTATION.md` and `PROGRESS.md` files.
- Analyze the existing `simulation.ts` file to identify logical components for separation.
- Define clear boundaries and responsibilities for each new module.
- Consult with the user on technology stack selection, application structure, scalability considerations, and initial implementation plan with distinct phases.

### Phase 2: Module Extraction
- Extract the `MatchResult`, `Player`, and `SimulationConfig` interfaces into a new `types.ts` file.
- Extract the `TournamentSimulation` class into a new `tournament.ts` file.
- Extract the `runSimulation` and `generatePlayers` functions into a new `runner.ts` file.
- Ensure all imports are updated correctly.

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- Create unit tests for each new module to ensure functionality is preserved.
- Run existing tests to confirm no regressions were introduced.
- Document any deviations from the plan.

### Phase 4: Code Review and Refinement
- Review the refactored code for consistency and best practices.
- Refactor any code exceeding 300 lines.
- Update documentation as needed.

### Phase 5: Final Verification
- Verify all acceptance criteria are met.
- Update `PROGRESS.md` with the final status.
- Ensure code consistency across all modules.

## Dependencies
- None

## Expected Outcomes
- A more modular and maintainable simulation system.
- Improved code readability and testability.
- No regressions in existing functionality.
